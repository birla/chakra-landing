    headline: We are Anqurit
    subtitle: "We Sprout Everything.\n\nWith **Anqurit** you can be sure of Quality and Hygiene.\n\n\nWhy Sprouted, you ask?\n\n1.  Physical Reasons:\n    Healthy and Full grain. Clean. Washed away Pesticides. Dead Grain about to be a live Plant.\n\n\n2.  Easy to Digest:\n    In the process of Sprouting, all complex Vitamins, Carbohydrates, Gluten & Minerals chains become very simple so that the tiny sprout can easily consume them. That makes it very easily digestible by humans.\n\n\n3.  Absorption:\n    Phytic Acids inherently present in the barn of the Grain inhibits availability of Minerals and Vitamins by binding with them. The process of Soaking and Sprouting breaks them down thus the said Nutrients are now easily available to human body for absorption by intestine.\n\n\n4.  That simply means, more and easily available Nutirents resulting in improved Immunity and better Health.\n\n\n5.  Specially helpful for Weight control, Pesticide intolerance, Gluten intolerance, Diabetes, Indigestion, Cholesterol conditions and improving overall health.\_\n\n\\*In many ways, this make them better than Organic.\n"
