          Healthy and full grains used. Cleaned and washed several times to
          remove any Dirt and Pesticides.
      - title: Easy to Digest
        description: >
          In the process of Sprouting, all complex Vitamins, Carbohydrates,
          Gluten & Mineral chains become non-compound and pure. Each tiny Sprout
          can then easily consume them, making it very easily digestible for
          humans.
      - title: Absorption
        description: >
          Phytic Acids inherently present in the barn of the Grain inhibit the
          availability of Minerals and Vitamins by binding with them. The
          process of Soaking and Sprouting breaks them down, thus the said
          Nutrients become easily available to human body for absorption by the
          intestine.
      - title: Bottom Line?
        description: >
